      "*   **Surface Gravity & Escape Velocity:** Its mass of 2.36 Earth masses and radius of 1.34 Earth radii gives it a surface gravity of approximately 1.3g. This is higher than Earth's, but likely tolerable for many terrestrial organisms. The escape velocity is also higher, meaning it can retain an atmosphere for a considerable time. Higher gravity could also benefit the longevity of the atmosphere as lighter gasses will have more difficulty escaping the gravitational pull of the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Atmospheric Retention Capability:** The higher gravity significantly aids in atmospheric retention. Its higher mass and lower temperature would increase the time an atmosphere could remain intact, however, a weaker magnetosphere would reduce atmospheric lifespan.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Liquid Water Stability:** A temperature of 241K (-32 degrees Celsius) without atmospheric effects suggests that liquid water would freeze at the surface. However, this does not mean there is no chance for liquid water on the planet. The presence of an atmosphere (specifically a greenhouse effect from gasses like CO2 and Methane) could cause the average temperature of the planet to rise. Subsurface oceans are another possibility (like those theorized on Europa and Enceladus).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Stellar Radiation & Magnetosphere Protection:** This is a critical area. Kepler-442 is a K-type star, cooler and less massive than our Sun. The lower mass of the star makes it last a long time, giving plenty of time for life to evolve. K-type stars emit less UV radiation than G-type stars (like our Sun), which is beneficial for habitability, as excess UV radiation is harmful to life. Given that it is orbiting a K star, it is much more likely to be tidally locked, which would impact the atmosphere and the climate of the planet. Whether or not Kepler-442 b has a magnetosphere remains unknown, but this plays a critical role in long-term atmospheric stability. If it lacks a global magnetic field, charged particles from the star (stellar wind) can erode the atmosphere over geological timescales, stripping away vital components like water.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Surface Gravity & Escape Velocity:** A mass of 136.66 Earth masses and a radius of 12.89 Earth radii result in incredibly high surface gravity.  Using the formula *g = GM/r¬≤*, where *G* is the gravitational constant, *M* is the mass, and *r* is the radius, we can calculate the approximate surface gravity. Without doing the full calculation, we can already infer it would be immensely stronger than Earth's. This presents immense problems.\n",
      "    *   **Extreme Pressure:** The sheer weight of the atmosphere under such gravity would result in crushing pressures at the surface. Any life forms would need to be extremely robust to withstand this.  Moreover, this pressure makes liquid water on the surface highly improbable.\n",

Its stellar temperature of 5972 K (compared to our Sun's ~5778 K) suggests a slightly higher emission of UV and X-ray radiation. Without a substantial magnetosphere *and* a protective atmosphere, this radiation would sterilize the surface and contribute to atmospheric erosion. We have no information indicating Kepler-422 b has a magnetosphere, and given its size and unknown internal structure, there's no guarantee it does.\n",

Without knowing this, it is difficult to calculate the location of the habitable zone. It seems highly improbable that it orbits within a plausible habitable zone, given the combination of the star's temperature and the planet's temperature. Even if it were, the other factors would make habitability unlikely.\n",
